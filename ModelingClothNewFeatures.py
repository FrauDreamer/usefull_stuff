# -------------------------------- START save states
# Save current state will let you create a shape key for each time you like your cloth settings.
# It will need to respect armature or other deforms so we'll have to think about the modifier stack and so on.
# maybe create the little arrows in the ui to let you move up and down through your saved state.
# Name each shape key with something that let's the UI know which keys to scroll through.
# !!! Will need the modeling cloth to switch to your current selected state instead of writing to the modeling cloth key!!!
# Need to think about which modifiers to turn on and off here... Anything that changes the vert count has to go.
#   Might be able to check which modifiers have the "apply as shape" option.
#   Blender might have already sorted mods that change vertex counts in this way
